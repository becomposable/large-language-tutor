          This is an experiment to work with LLM (Large Language Models) to
          create a language tutor and assistant that aids in language learning.

          We've utilized a large language model (specifically GPT-4) and adopted
          a multi-agent/multi-task approach to implement features and behaviors.
          Structured data I/O facilitates the integration of the LLM's
          processing capabilities into the app.

        <Text py={2}>
          The intention is to delegate deterministic tasks to the application's
          business logic while leaning on the LLM for undeterministic tasks.
          This is achieved by translating results from the LLM into the
          applications through a structured schema. States are crafted using
          Interactions, which consist of parametrized Prompt Segments and Input
          Dataâ€”essentially, data schema responses from the LLM.

        <Text py={2}>
          The primary objective was to explore potential programming models for
          LLM-driven learning systems. The applications span general education
          (like math and science) to corporate training and knowledge
          maintenance.
