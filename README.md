# (Large) Language Tutor

This is an experiment to work with LLM to create a language tutor and assistant, to help people learn languages,
created by the team at [Composable Prompts](https://composableprompts.com), as part as our initial research into programing models for LLMs.

It uses a large language model (in this case GPT4) to perform its tasks, and a multi-agent / multi-task approach to implement the features and behavior,
and structured data in/out of the LLM to present and integrate the LLM processing power into the app. The idea is to orchestrate tasks in the business logic of the applications
while relying on the LLM to perform the undeterministic tasks, and integrate the processing result in the applications via structured schema.
States are created using Interactions, a set of parametrized Prompt Segments and Input Data, Data Schema requested from the LLM as its answer.

The goal of this app was to explore possible programming models for LLM-powered learning systems.
It could be applied to a wide set of learning education either generalist (like math, science), or corporate (internal training,
support agent training, knowledge maintenance, etc.).

The application offers the following core features.


## Conversations

Practice reading and writing in a conversational style, with the tutor, powered by the LLM. It is helpful you practice daily life situation or simple practive writing.

  - Conversation with live streaming on any topic

  - Live Checking: each message written by the user gets verified in the background. An indication of correctness is displayed, and the user can clic to open the explanation.

  - Live Dictionnary: Words are clickable to get a live definition, generated by the tutor, and expressed in the language of the user.

  - Explanation: the Tutor can explain any message, breaking it down, to help with understanding while learning

System and Safety prompts keep the LLM on track and clear on its mission. State is transmitted with each prompt so the LLM keeps context. It's possible to tinker more with the prompts to see how it would change the engagement and entertainment level.


## Stories and Original Content

Generate stories, and more practical content (work procedure, coocking recipe, office policy, etc.), using various ideas and styles dynamically suggested by the Tutor, or defined by the user.

The options aren't fixed, they are dynamically created by the LLM, from some seeds in the prompt (and we could make the seeds from user's interest or learning goals).

- Questions & Answers: Request questions on the content, generated by the tutor and adapted to the content and user level

- Correct user's answers dynamically and report back to the user how they have done.

## Explain or Verify anything

Often, when learning a new language it's useful to either verify a sentence before using it
(to make sure it's natural, it's the right level of language, it convey the right intent).
Often as well it's useful to not just have the translation of something, but to understand the structure, composition and words
in order to learn. That's what the Explain & Verify feature provide.

- Verify: will check the content and give feedback about if it's natural, what is the level and tone, and possible improvements.

- Explain: will breakdown and explain the content to help the user understand it, not just translate, indicate the language level, and offer ways to answer or continue the comversation.

## Deploy it? Test it?

If you'd like to test it, you can either deploy this repository on Vercel, CloudRun, Atlas for example (that's our production setup).

Or give it a try here: [(Large) Language Tutor](https://langtutor.dglabs.dev>) (login with any Google Account).


## Improvements Ideas

We're (at dengenlabs) focusing on advancing [Composable Prompts](https://composableprompts.com),
that we used this application to test programming models for LLMs. 

We plan to port the app on composable prompts in the coming weeks, to show how it simplifies and accelerate powering applications with LLMs.

In addition we had a few ideas that we will explore over the coming months (and feel free to contribute):

- Store words the user read / click in a timeserie on to identify what words need practice and create a feedback loop into the LLM to adapt the language and focus on words to learn

- Integrate Pictures into stories and conversations to make them more interesting to read

- Detect the user's level based on her writing, to monitor progress and display it

- Dyanmically generate a learning cursus that the Tutor would then follow for a used, based on the user's interest and level.

Feel free to fill issues and ideas if you's like to share
